        <p>Coffee Road has started moving towards different directions in the Philippines with its end-view of bringing Barako coffee bean (Coffea Liberica) to local consumers nationwide. Coffee Road is also our way of support in reviving the glory of our very own Barako coffee.</p>
        <p>Coffee Road is simply Batangas coffee. Its main variety is the famous roasted Barako coffee beans but it also offers other varieties such as Robusta and Excelsa roasted coffee beans (whole and ground). The quality of roasting and freshness are the trademarks of Coffee Road. Its Compass Logo simply implies that Coffee Road is firmly committed to bring its traditional coffee lines to different directions in the Philippines for the satisfaction of every coffee enthusiast. Make Coffee Road, your next stop for your coffee needs and enjoy the freshness of our roasted coffee when youâ€™re at home or at work.</p>
