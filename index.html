        <h2>Coffee Road update2</h2>
        <p>Coffee Road has started moving towards different directions in the Philippines with its end-view of bringing Barako coffee bean (Coffea Liberica) to local consumers nationwide. Coffee Road is also our way of support in reviving the glory of our very own Barako coffee.</p>
        <p>The town of Ibaan is one of the coffee roads in the province of Batangas being near to Lipa City, where the first coffee bean of Coffea Liberica was planted in the 1740s. From there, it spread to other areas in the province and Batangas became known for its coffee locally. Traditionally cooked coffee, mixed with brown sugar, became part of the local residents daily meals. In fact, the terms “sabaw sa kape” and “sinsay muna” (come here for a cup of coffee) have originated from Batangas because of its abundant supply of coffee. </p>
        <p>Barako, which means “stud” is associated with the image of masculinity. Similarly, Barako, as a coffee bean, has a strong flavor and distinctive aroma or fragrance. It has a unique, authentic and traditional appeal, which makes it superior over other varieties also produced locally such as Robusta and Excelsa.</p>
        <p>Coffee Road is simply Batangas coffee. Its main variety is the famous roasted Barako coffee beans but it also offers other varieties such as Robusta and Excelsa roasted coffee beans (whole and ground). The quality of roasting and freshness are the trademarks of Coffee Road. Its Compass Logo simply implies that Coffee Road is firmly committed to bring its traditional coffee lines to different directions in the Philippines for the satisfaction of every coffee enthusiast. Make Coffee Road, your next stop for your coffee needs and enjoy the freshness of our roasted coffee when you’re at home or at work.</p>
